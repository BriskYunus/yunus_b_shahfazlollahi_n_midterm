Thames River Anglers Association Midterm Assignment

By: Brisk Yunus & Nick Shahfazlollahi.

Brisk and I have created a 1 page 6 section website. The site contains a sticky nav bar for easy navigation and access. We also organized the information into the 6 sections: Home, About, Events, Projects, Links & Newsletter, Contact us.

Brisk used Javascript to animate TRAA's slogan on the top section of the site and also used CSS on the nav bar for a highlighting hover effect. He also added a hover effect to the 3 merch parts on the home page.

Nick coded 4 data viz graphs using python3 using the given data on excel regarding TRAA's data of memberships, Rainbow/Brown Trout Eggs and Rainbow Trout Caught.

We used 2 fonts from Font Squirrel and we added 3 backup fonts incase the font squirrel fonts dont load.

We hope to apply the given feedback at the presentation day for the final.
